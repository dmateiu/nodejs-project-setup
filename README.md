# Blueprint for node.js project setup

This project serves as a blueprint for the initial setup of my node.js projects.

It comes with a minimal set of rules and tools, that have proven to be convenient 
in projects I've been working on in the last couple of years.

### List of tools

* **editorconfig** - *helps maintain consistent coding styles*
* **eslint** - *static analysis to find problematic patterns or code that doesn't adhere to certain style guidelines*
* **husky** - *supports running scripts on git hooks*
* **lint-staged** - *runs scripts on staged files*
* **commitlint** - *check if commit messages meet the conventional commit format*
* **nodemon** - *restart node application when file changes are detected*
* **jest** - *javascript testing framework*
* **npm-check** - *check for outdated, incorrect, and unused dependencies*
* **dotenv-flow** - *load environment variables from `.env` file into process.env*
* **license-checker** - *verify licenses of all dependencies*
